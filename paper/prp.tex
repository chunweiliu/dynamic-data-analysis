\begin{abstract}
The analysis of pediatric airway geometry using computed tomography (CT) images has provided rich diagnostic cues for doctors. Recently, dynamic CT data provides a better characterization of pediatric airways throughout the breathing cycle, for example to assess tracheomalacia. However, how to preprocess the increasing amount of dynamic data and how to analysis these data are still open questions. In this work, I performed dynamic data analysis using computer vision and machine learning approaches on synthetic and real airway data. In the future, I aim at building a 4D atlas for pediatric airways and to extend the approaches to other dynamic data modalities.
